# Matplotlib-and-Seaborn-projects
This repository contains two mini projects demonstrating data analysis and machine learning skills using Python:

COVID-19 Data Analysis
Iris Dataset Classification

Project 1: COVID-19 Data Analysis
Overview

Analyzes COVID-19 trends worldwide, including confirmed cases, deaths, and recoveries. Visualizations help understand the pandemicâ€™s spread over time.

Dataset

Source: Kaggle COVID-19 Dataset

Columns: Date, Country/Region, Confirmed, Deaths, Recovered

Objectives

Explore global COVID-19 trends.

Visualize country-wise statistics.

Identify countries with the highest cases and fatalities.

Tools & Libraries

Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn

How to Run
jupyter notebook covid19_analysis.ipynb

Project 2: Iris Dataset Classification
Overview

Classifies iris flowers into three species using features like sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width. Demonstrates machine learning workflow from exploration to classification.

Source: UCI Iris Dataset

Columns: SepalLengthCm, SepalWidthCm, PetalLengthCm, PetalWidthCm, Species

Objectives

Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) and visualize relationships.

Train classification models (Logistic Regression, KNN, Decision Trees).

Evaluate model performance using accuracy and confusion matrix.

Tools & Libraries

Python, pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn

How to Run
jupyter notebook iris_classification.ipynb
